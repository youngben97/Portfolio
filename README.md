#Portfolio for Benjamin Young

This repo contains code for my online portfolio. I have developed it with the intention of it being shown to potential employers. When you load the portfolio you are presented with my name, an avatar, and a nav bar that leads to different sections on the page.

When you click on a link in the nav bar, it will scroll to the corresponding section on the page. The section about my work contains a link to a deployed app; links can also be found in my contact section that allow someone to email me or view my Github page.

I have also utilized media queries so that the page changes according to the size of the viewport.

I intend to revisit this repo throughout the course of the bootcamp I am enrolled in so that I can continue to build and refine it.
